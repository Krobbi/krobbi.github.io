# Templates
Below is a list of links to templates for custom software license texts created
by Chris Roberts (Krobbizoid), ordered alphabetically:

## Krobbizoid Proprietary-Open Game Development License
[Template](https://krobbi.github.io/license/template/kpogdl.txt)

The Krobbizoid Proprietary-Open Game Development License (KPOGDL) is a
relatively restrictive open-source software license. It is intended to allow
game developers to make a game open-source for some time during development,
while granting them the rights to stop open-source development or release the
game commercially. It also explicitly grants players permission to make mods or
media based on the game.

## Modified non-commercial MIT License
[Template](https://krobbi.github.io/license/template/mnc-mit.txt) _(Deprecated)_

The Modified non-commercial MIT License (MNC-MIT) is a modified MIT License
which prohibits the software from being used commercially in any way. It was
originally created to ensure that
[a Minecraft mod](https://github.com/krobbi/fabricmc-endfix) complied with the
relevant terms and conditions. The license for that project has since been
replaced with the standard MIT license. Using this license is not recommended.

_MNC-MIT is not affiliated with MIT or the MIT License._
